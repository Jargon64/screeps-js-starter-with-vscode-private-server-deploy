# Screeps JS Starter Project with Private Server VSCode Build Deployment using Gulp

Run `npm install` after checking out. You might need to restart VSCode after this.

Configure your credentials for either the official or a private server (or both) in the `credentials.js` file
and when you are ready to deploy, pres `Ctrl + Shift + B` in VSCode and select the desired build action from the list.

The email address it wants is your Steam email address.

If you haven't set a password yet, you'll need to set it here:

http://private.server.host.or.ip:21025/web/change-password

You need to sign in to Steam in your browser before you can change your password (Screeps uses Steam auth tokens behind the scenes).

**DO NOT USE YOUR STEAM PASSWORD FOR A SCREEPS PRIVATE SERVER**
